# Chapter 5: Parsing HTML

In this chapter, we will learn how to write scripts that parse HTML files on the web and extract useful information. Before we dive into working with HTML files, let us quickly review what they typically look like.

Let us jump right into looking into a basic example
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>  
<html>  
    <head>
      <title>I am a first example</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1> Hello World </h1>
        <p> Here is a paragraph </p>
        <p> Here is a another one!</p>
    <body>
</html>
```

You can find this file in `hello.html`.
